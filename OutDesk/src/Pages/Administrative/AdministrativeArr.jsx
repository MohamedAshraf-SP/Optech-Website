Additionally, research from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) indicates that outsourcing administrative tasks can save businesses approximately £5,000 to £15,000 annually in operational costs.<br/><br/>Our administrative virtual assistants (VAs) specialise in a range of tasks, including paperwork, calendar scheduling, CRM updates, handling reception calls, bookkeeping, expense management, and executive support. This allows you to focus on what truly drives your business forward.<br/><br/>MyBudgetStaff VAs are carefully vetted to seamlessly integrate into your company, and partnering with us can save you up to 70% compared to hiring a traditional employee in the UK.
